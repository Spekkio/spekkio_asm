A modifiable assembler, you can add instructions sets under instr_sets/

I started doing this because I wanted an assembler that could support
any Microchip MCU. Using the syntax in the description
of the instruction set from the Microchip MCU Datasheets.

Currently I have added the DCPU-16 instruction set from the game 0x10c.

Currently, the assembler cannot do anything. It cannot parse asm files.
This is a work in progress.
