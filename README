A modifiable assembler, you can add instructions sets under instr_sets/

I started doing this because I wanted an assembler that could support
any Microchip MCU. Using the syntax in the description
of the instruction set from the Microchip MCU Datasheets.

Currently I have added the DCPU-16 instruction set from the game 0x10c.

This is the output from the assembler as it looks now with DCPU specification loaded.
As you can see it does not compute the value of the pointers yet.
